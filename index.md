### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    In Lab 5, I particularly enjoyed part 2, as me and my partners created a program to convert feet in decimals into feet and inches. The reasoning behind my enjoyment was particularly due to how smoothly the programming went, as we ran into very few errors, and the program came together quickly and easily.

* Lab 6

    Looking back on it, I really enjoyed part 2 of Lab 6, even if I got really mad while I was working on it. Writing Blackjack functions was fun! The mistakes I made got me pretty mad, but I ended up learning from them, which will hopefully prevent any if-statement related problems in the future! As a whole, this lab also introduced me to command line vectors, which are pretty helpful.

* Lab 8

    This lab was VERY problematic for me, specifically part 2. I ran into multiple logic errors, where the code would run, but I wouldn't get the correct result. The concept of inner and outer loops were confusing to me, especially with how I was a beginner to coding in C++. Eventually it got done, and the pattern was formed beautifully, but it was still a very big struggle. If anything, I only enjoyed this one because of the satisfaction that came with finally being able to complete it.
